# Packages used in this project

1. Redux: For global state management I have used redux. The benefit of using redux is to have a state of the object in one place and it is easy for other components to read data using the selector.
2. Bootstrap: For UI elements I have used bootstrap. The main benefit of using bootstrap is to give us powerful capabilities of HTML elements and SCSS. Also, onboarding new developers will always be easy because bootstrap is very popular in the market.
3. Axios: I have used Axios for fetching the data from the server. I always recommend developers to use Axios because it is trendy and very powerful also it has some powerful methods like Axios retry if API call fails and Axios interceptor that is why I recommend developers to use Axios instead of fetch method.
4. Moment JS: Dealing with dates and times in javascript is a very hectic problem and you have to spend a lot of time converting dates to your desired format. That's why moment.js is one of the libraries which is very powerful and it makes your life easy.
